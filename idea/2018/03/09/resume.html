<p>While looking for a new job after moving to Canada, I decided
to create a simple tool for generating the resume. The European
format I was used to is very different from the North American
approach, so I wanted to have some fun while working on it.</p>

<p>This project uses:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Gulp for tasks (generating HTML, reading JSON data etc.)</li>
  <li>Nunjucks for the HTML template</li>
  <li>JSON for storing the resume data</li>
  <li>CSS for styling</li>
</ul>

<p>Check out my pure HTML + CSS <a href="/resume">resume</a> created with this 
tool.</p>
