    <p>Hi, if you’re reading this (especially Alicja’s Polish translation), then you certainly don’t know me yet. Let me introduce myself.</p>

<p>I’m Juliano, Alicja’s batch-mate from Brazil!</p>

<p>Now that that’s out of the way, let me tell you about Elixir and ElixirConf 2016.</p>

<p>Elixir is an up and coming programming language made by another Brazilian. It leverages a lot of ancient technology (Erlang) and is built in a modern, attractive and well thought out way, making awesome stuff accessible to a broader range of programmers. The community is pretty awesome. People are genuinely friendly and patient and they make an effort to make things accessible to everyone at every level.</p>

<p>ElixirConf 2016 was set in the <a href="http://www.swandolphin.com/">Disney Swan and Dolphin Resert</a>. It was raining hard and natives from Orlando were talking about “hurricane season”, which I thought was more exciting than Disney itself.</p>

<p>Ever since I arrived to NY I’ve been waiting for a flu to catch me. The weather was very hot, the subway stations were even hotter, and the trains were freezing cold. To me, the NY subway system is like a massive human pasteurization machine, where they successively bake and freeze you between train stops and connections, until all of your bacteria are dead. The cold arrived right on time for ElixirConf and I spent my first conference day with a fever, sore throat and an artificially deep voice. Even so, it was awesome and well worth it.</p>

<p>ElixirConf has doubled in size compared to last year. I was there too during ElixirConf 2015, and actually got a free copy of “Seven More Programming Languages in Seven Weeks” as a “Longest Distance Travelled” Award. We were some 200 programmers flying in from a lot of different places to meet other people excited about this cool new language with an uncertain future. Very few of us were actually using Elixir in our day jobs. Things have changed a bit. This year we were 542 and around 30% of attendees say they run Elixir in their day jobs!</p>

<p>We are a heavy flock of newbies coming into a technology stack that has been there since the 80’s, so there is eventually some friction. Some old-time Erlang developers are not happy with that, which became fuel for jokes in some presentations.</p>

<p>This year, many of the talks were from companies actively using Elixir, talking about their success stories and things they learned. I personally like that kind of presentations a lot.</p>

<p>Conferences are, in the end, much more than just the talks. I’ve met some very nice people from Brazil who were also attending and had a chance to talk at length with some of Elixir’s creators and core contributors. Meeting again with people I’ve seen last year gave the conference sort of a feeling of family, and knowing that many of them, like me, are still not using Elixir at work made me feel that Jessica Kerr’s tear-inducing keynote from last year (<a href="https://youtu.be/X25xOhntr6s">here</a>) still echoed in everyone’s hearts.</p>

<p>I’ve also been high-fived by a Michigan fan and approached by two Detroit residents during the conference because I bought a Michigan hoodie at the Detroit airport so I wouldn’t freeze to death during my 10 hour connection.</p>

<p>The closing keynote was done by Boyd Multerer, former engineering leader for Microsoft’s Xbox console for the last 14 years. He gave a very thought provoking presentation and spoke at length about why he chose Elixir and Erlang as his career investment for the next 10 years. It was a very rewarding talk to watch, hearing Boyd come up with compelling reasons why, for him, the Erlang VM and Elixir are the best fit for technology in the next decade, giving confirmation to the intellectual, emotional and financial investment we all had in the language.</p>

<p>I left early, still feeling a little bit feverish, but very much inspired to go back to the RC and write more Elixir.</p>
