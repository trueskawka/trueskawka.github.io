  <div>
    <p>I changed the default English pronoun I use to <code class="highlighter-rouge">they</code> some time ago. For a long time I thought it 
impossible to incorporate a similar approach in my native language, until I realized I’ve been doing 
it all along.</p>

    <h3>The curb cut effect of the Internet</h3>
  </a>
  

  <div>
    <p>I recently listened to an episode of the 99% Invisible podcast on <a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/curb-cuts/transcript/">curb cuts</a> 
and it made me pause to appreciate some of the curb cuts I experienced. One with 
the most profound impact on my life is the Internet.</p>

    <h3>Browsing in grayscale</h3>
  </a>
  

  <div>
    <p>I started exploring my browsing habits to better understand why certain websites grab my attention.
As aware of UX dark patterns as I am, I grew tired of mindfully noticing when they want to “nudge” 
me into certain behaviors with vibrant colors and obscuring others by making them less visually
appealing.</p>

    <p>I encountered a thread in a community group chat asking for advice on guiding someone through improving English skills. Some of the resources and ideas I shared were helpful, so I decided to write a longer blog post about it.</p>

  <div>
    <p>We recently organized <a href="https://www.meetup.com/codecoffeeyvr/events/249207842/">Conf &amp; Coffee 2018</a> in Vancouver, BC,
and one of the bigger tasks we had to take care of was designing and printing our conference badges. A conference is 
all about people - people who come there to learn, meet new people and have a good time. We wanted
to make it easier for them and create useable badges.</p>

    <h3>Drawing with CSS - part 2: linear gradients</h3>
  </a>
  

  <div>
    <p>The first part of the drawing with CSS tutorial was all about 
<a href="/mini-jekyll-deploy/blog/programming/2018/02/07/drawing-with-CSS-part-1-box-shadows.html">box shadows</a>.
They are pretty flexible when it comes to creating multiple rectangular and circular shapes, but there are some
limitations.</p>

    <h3>Drawing with CSS - part 1: box shadows</h3>
  </a>
  

  <div>
    <p>I have been using CSS as a medium for drawing for the past few months and I appreciate its
versatility and wide support. Since it’s hard to get started without understanding the 
basic concepts and most of the online guides are not focusing on how to draw images with
CSS, I decided to write a few simple guides on creating single div CSS images. In the first
part I’ll focus on drawing using box shadows.</p>

  <div>
    <p>I have paired a lot over the past week (which makes me tremendously happy!)
and I noticed how lost I can get in someone else’s terminal if I don’t have
my regular bash prompt - not only the cute little heart that welcomes me
every time I run the terminal, but also the git branch name I’m currently on.</p>

  <div>
    <p>As my second batch at the Recurse Center is approaching, I can’t help
but to be excited for all the pairings to come. I enjoy learning by 
working with others - other than improving my coding style and understanding
how to solve problems better, I always pick up all sorts of little tweaks 
and ideas while geeking out over someone’s setup.</p>

    <h3>Designing HTML emails</h3>
  </a>
  

  <div>
    <p>It’s 2017 and it seems that plain text emails are just boring for most users.
Communicating without the emoji, GIFs or images seems rather stiff and your
brand is better than that! It’s approachable and fun, or sleek and high-end, or
in some other way remarkable. No plain text email will do.</p>

  <div>
    <p>I recently got inspired to try pure CSS single div
animations, as I came across <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2014/09/single-div-drawings-with-css/">this blog post</a> (thank you, Gabrielle!).
There were only two problems:</p>

    <p>24 weeks ago I entered the Recurse Center in New York, not sure what to
expect. I’ve only known what I was able to find online and anything I could
gather from introductory emails. I flew to another continent based on the gut
feeling that this is the right thing to do and not being able to explain
what <em>this</em> was exactly.</p>

  <div>
    <p>When I first heard Zulip is taking part in Google Code-In and was asked to
become a mentor, I got excited. And scared. The more time passed, the more
scared I was, feeling inadequate and not experienced enough to review other
people’s code.</p>

  <div>
    <p>One of my fellow Recursers is actively researching needs of newbie
developers and interviewing juniors, mentors and anyone else engaged in hiring programmers who are starting out. Given my experience so far, I more than qualified for an interview as a tech industry newbie.</p>

    <p>Recently I’ve had the pleasure of seeing <a href="https://www.harihareswara.net/">Sumana Harihareswara</a> live documenting <a href="https://zulip.tabbott.net/#narrow/stream/test.20suites/topic/watch.20over.20my.20shoulder.20as.20I.20improve.20the.20linter">a coding adventure</a> on Zulip.

  <div>
    <p>I have recently reread <a href="https://www.amazon.com/First-20-Hours-Learn-Anything/dp/1591846943">The First 20 Hours: How To Learn Anything… Fast!</a> by Josh Kaufman - a light book with some helpful insights on acquiring new skills. As I have so much to learn and so little time (or at least so is my perception), the concept of spending just 20 hours on something and going from knowing nothing to performing noticeably well is appealing.</p>
