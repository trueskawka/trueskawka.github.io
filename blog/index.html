    <h3>On passing for a native speaker</h3>

    <p>I came to realize how many thoughts I have around my English accent. It’s a mix of pride and anxiety, and this is discomfort I’m not going to get away from anytime soon.</p>

    <h3>Retrieving drawings from Notability</h3>
  </a>
  

  <div>
    <p>I use <a href="https://www.gingerlabs.com/">Notability</a> a lot to take notes while learning and during meetings. It’s fast and comfortable, allowing me to jot down my ideas on the fly. One caveat of taking notes in this way is that they’re not easily exportable in an editable format, so I can’t reuse them in other contexts (e.g. when creating diagrams to explain ideas).</p>

    <p>I changed the default English pronoun I use to <code class="highlighter-rouge">they</code> some time ago. For a long time I thought it 
impossible to incorporate a similar approach in my native language, until I realized I’ve been doing 
it all along.</p>

    <p>I recently listened to an episode of the 99% Invisible podcast on <a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/curb-cuts/transcript/">curb cuts</a>

the most profound impact on my life is the Internet.</p>

    <p>I started exploring my browsing habits to better understand why certain websites grab my attention.
As aware of UX dark patterns as I am, I grew tired of mindfully noticing when they want to “nudge” 
me into certain behaviors with vibrant colors and obscuring others by making them less visually
appealing.</p>

    <p>We recently organized <a href="https://www.meetup.com/codecoffeeyvr/events/249207842/">Conf &amp; Coffee 2018</a> in Vancouver, BC,
and one of the bigger tasks we had to take care of was designing and printing our conference badges. A conference is 
all about people - people who come there to learn, meet new people and have a good time. We wanted
to make it easier for them and create useable badges.</p>

    <p>The first part of the drawing with CSS tutorial was all about 
<a href="/blog/programming/2018/02/07/drawing-with-CSS-part-1-box-shadows.html">box shadows</a>.
They are pretty flexible when it comes to creating multiple rectangular and circular shapes, but there are some
limitations.</p>

    <h3>Drawing with CSS - part 1: box shadows</h3>
  </a>
  

  <div>
    <p>I have been using CSS as a medium for drawing for the past few months and I appreciate its
versatility and wide support. Since it’s hard to get started without understanding the 
basic concepts and most of the online guides are not focusing on how to draw images with
CSS, I decided to write a few simple guides on creating single div CSS images. In the first
part I’ll focus on drawing using box shadows.</p>

    <p>I have paired a lot over the past week (which makes me tremendously happy!)

my regular bash prompt - not only the cute little heart that welcomes me
every time I run the terminal, but also the git branch name I’m currently on.</p>

    <p>As my second batch at the Recurse Center is approaching, I can’t help
but to be excited for all the pairings to come. I enjoy learning by 
working with others - other than improving my coding style and understanding
how to solve problems better, I always pick up all sorts of little tweaks 
and ideas while geeking out over someone’s setup.</p>

    <p>It’s 2017 and it seems that plain text emails are just boring for most users.
Communicating without the emoji, GIFs or images seems rather stiff and your
brand is better than that! It’s approachable and fun, or sleek and high-end, or
in some other way remarkable. No plain text email will do.</p>

As I have so much to learn and so little time (or at least so is my perception), the concept of spending just 20 hours on something and going from knowing nothing to performing noticeably well is appealing.</p>
