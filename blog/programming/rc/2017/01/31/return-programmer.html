  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>24 weeks ago I entered the Recurse Center in New York, not sure what to
expect. I’ve only known what I was able to find online and anything I could
gather from introductory emails. I flew to another continent based on the gut
feeling that this is the right thing to do and not being able to explain
what <em>this</em> was exactly.</p>

<h2 id="expectations">Expectations</h2>

<p>I have submitted my RC application on a whim when life didn’t feel quite where
I wanted it to be in March last year. It was surprisingly easy to answer
two core questions on the application form:</p>

<h3 id="what-do-you-want-to-be-doing-in-two-years">What do you want to be doing in two years?</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>I want to work with people who are smarter than me and learn.
I want to have a remote job that allows me to travel and work.
I want to make products that suit the users’ needs.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="why-do-you-want-to-attend-the-recurse-center">Why do you want to attend the Recurse Center?</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>I want to kick-off and have a new start.
For the last few years I’ve been an analyst/programmer/whatever-is-needed
and I didn’t really have a clear idea on what I want to do.
Going abroad for a few months and creating something from scratch sounds
like a great idea to finally start being a full-time programmer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Looking back, I’m not that surprised I got in, even though when I first
got my acceptance email a month later I was shocked. (<em>Me? The person who
couldn’t even code a proper recursive FizzBuzz?</em>) The answers above are
very much in RC-spirit, even though I’m not sure I can pin down what that
means.</p>

<h2 id="people">People</h2>

<p>The Recurse Center is primarily and predominantly about people. It’s not
just a space where we can hang out all the time (sometimes literally days
at a time), with WiFi, beanbags and coffee. A co-working space or a start-up
office doesn’t quite describe it.</p>

<p>Imagine a place where you can always find someone to talk to and ask any
question. When you get to spend time with someone, they are fully engaged
in the conversation, whether it’s helping you find a fairly straightforward
typo in your code, learning a new paradigm together, late-night discussions
or listening just because you need it.</p>

<p>It’s a community where you can make friends nearly instantaneously.
Sure, not everyone is going to be your bestie - after all, without diversity
it would be a very boring community. When you meet the people you resonate
with, it’s like a first date - time flies as you end up talking about anything
and everything.</p>

<p>Daily check-ins and check-outs to motivate and discuss problems,
building projects together and attending workshops, morning meditation,
group sightseeing and hiking, arcade games, drinks, karaoke… It’s a big
and lively community, with something to suit everyone’s needs.</p>

<h2 id="space">Space</h2>

<p>There is a lot of light, thanks to huge windows and a pretty big central
space. There are rooms where one could hide should there be too much noise
from people discussing, lunching and enjoying each others’ company. Beanbags
and coffee mugs are everywhere, as are programming books.</p>

<p>RC has a good balance between having enough space for tens of people at a
time and still being warm and cozy. Sometimes one has to wait for
the “perfect” spot to work or make sure they come early enough to get the
big coffee mug. Sometimes it’s overcrowded in a friendly way during
community events like presentations or job fairs.</p>

<p>It’s always a welcoming space, even though it’s ever-changing and adjusting
to the needs of every new batch. It’s also always open, so it’s easy enough
to fit everyone’s schedule, whether an early bird or extreme night owl.</p>

<h2 id="learning">Learning</h2>

<p>Learning as an adult is hard. Everything seems to be more important than
your personal growth right at this very moment. It doesn’t give you
immediate benefits, it requires a lot of work and dedication. It’s easy
enough to understand that someone wants to travel or just have a nice
evening out with friends. But there’s nothing glamorous or instantly
gratifying in sitting down and going through the complicated algorithm or
learning German grammar.</p>

<p>RC is self-motivated and self-paced. The freedom is overwhelming. There are
no constraints, apart from the vague deadline of the end of batch. Everyone
there wants to learn, which makes it easier, but also extremely hard - how
can you feel you’re growing enough when someone else is doing way more
interesting things, even though you’ve put in the work every day?</p>

<p>There is also the need to be honest with oneself. To know when you got lost
or the path you’ve chosen was not the right one. To tell yourself “I’m going
to try, even though this can turn out to be a mistake” and to admit “I was
mistaken, because I didn’t know enough”. Most importantly, it’s about keeping
oneself motivated and asking “what can I learn from this?”. After all, you
often can’t tell if something is going to be the right thing before you try it.</p>

<p>Going to RC, I wanted to learn all the things. I ended up learning things I
didn’t think I needed, which were usually not the things I’ve planned for.</p>

<h2 id="the-us">The US</h2>

<p>This was my very first time in the US and I didn’t expect it would be much
different from Europe. After all, I’ve been to places and seen things. Also,
<em>everyone</em> knows the American culture - the movies, the music, the never-ending
broadcast on everything American.</p>

<p>Yet I can see some pretty significant changes in my approach, many of which
were triggered by or learned from my American(ized) friends.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I don’t care what people think until I do. Walking around New York it
doesn’t matter that much how you look or what you are wearing, which is
something I’ve always been self-conscious about. I gained freedom to focus
on the important relationships, not worry about what could be.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I tried and failed a lot. Got up and failed again. Thanks to my newly
gained freedom from judgment, I’ve learned to try while I believe there is
a purpose to it.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I’ve learned to be more open. Coming up with a smile and talking to
strangers is the new normal. As is being open about money and expecting a fair
remuneration for one’s efforts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I challenge whining, especially my own rambling and negativity. It still
happens more often than I’d like, but each time I’m getting better at turning
things around and focusing on solutions rather than problems.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I embrace my inner introvert and preferred working hours. I no longer feel
guilty about not being a morning person or having <em>me</em> days, when I’d rather
just work instead of talking to people.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The moment I came in on a sunny Monday morning, I immediately embarrassed
myself by confusing some minor organizational thing. I then ran for the
coffee, trying to hide with half of a croissant and the overwhelming feeling
of being out of place. I was scared nobody will be able to understand my
accent. I was terrified I won’t be able to match their programming skills
and that by the end of the first week someone would politely ask me to go
back home and stop pretending I belong.</p>

<p>I’ve been welcomed with all my flaws and encouraged to embrace the obstacles,
real or imagined. I tend to talk about my life pre- and post-RC, because this
has been a transformative experience for me. I know how to grow and adjust
it to my needs. I’ve learned some things I hope future-me will keep in mind.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Time and attention are the most valuable resources you can give and receive.
The more of those we share with each other, the better our world is going to
be.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Having an “a-ha” moment together is the most magical experience. Whenever
possible, try to grow or help grow.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Honor all forms of progress. Your friend is doing it all wrong, learning
Python instead of falling head over heels into Haskell? You don’t think
anyone could ever be a good programmer without a CS degree? Let it go.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Don’t force yourself. I forced myself to get up in the morning and fit into
other people’s schedule. I forced myself to try things I didn’t feel like doing.
I forced myself to work on something I publicly said I would, even though I’ve
realized early on it doesn’t spark joy. If forcing yourself, it’s probably
time to change something.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do things your own way. I thought I needed to do “proper” pair programming, but
what I really needed was to have someone care about what I do and ask me the
right questions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>No regrets. There are so many people you can meet and work with, no way
you’re going to do something with all of them. And that’s okay.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It was exhausting, it was wonderful. New York might not be the place where
I’d like to live, but it’s definitely a place I want to keep coming back to.</p>
