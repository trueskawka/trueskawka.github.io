        How I grow

  <div class="post-content" itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>The past few months have been an ongoing adventure for me - an adventure in
learning to manage the <em>disorienting level of freedom</em> I’ve had to face.</p>

<p>This might sound ridiculous - after all, many dream of having enough time
for learning and growing. For focusing on whatever they want, not on what
they are told to. Especially for programmers, it seems like a dream come
true - a few months of working for the pure pleasure of it and contributing
to open-source projects? Count me in!</p>

<p>It’s been great. I have never been this happy. To wake up every day and feel
this is what I want to do, to think of code and in code with excitement.
I sometimes still feel not good or smart or experienced enough, but I never
feel it was the wrong choice.</p>

<p><em>Yes, and…</em></p>

<p>…and it’s very hard to stay on track. After all, programming
is full of opportunities - every day there are new libraries, patches,
languages and amazing projects created by someone on the Internet. It may
seem that there is never enough time to learn and the endless possibilities
can become suffocating. It’s extremely hard to stay creative when having
total freedom.</p>

<p>Because of that I’ve had to learn more about myself and what rules and
habits I need to set up for myself to keep growing.</p>

<h3 id="short-term-satisfaction-vs-long-term-happiness">Short-term satisfaction vs. long-term happiness</h3>

<p>It’s always easy to do simple, well-defined tasks. But apart from the
short-term satisfaction of ticking it off my to-do list or sharing my
progress publicly, there is not much else to it.</p>

<p>In order to be happy I need to do hard things. Untangle ill-defined and
fuzzy problems, navigate and unwrap spaghetti legacy code while implementing
a new feature - that’s what keeps me going.</p>

<p>I still need to have some easy wins on my to-do list, but they can’t take it
over. Working towards the long-term goal every day, regardless of my
motivation level, should be prioritized.</p>

<h3 id="sources-of-inspiration">Sources of inspiration</h3>

<p>I get inspired all the time:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>My inbox is full of newsletters and emails on programming, design, and
MOOCs I’d like to take part in.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I answer many questions every day, ranging from workflow skills, through
basic programming concepts and specific language issues, to intricate
problems I’m sometimes not sure I even understand. This makes me
constantly search for answers by using a lot of googling, skimming docs
and StackOverflow, but also through asking the right questions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Discussing any topic in the two realms I’m a user of can be a first step
to an hours-long or even all-night journey into a world of new concepts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reviewing submissions and reading others’ code inspires my to constantly
question my skills and look for answers - how did they do that? what’s
the issue here? how do I even…?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Playing boardgames. The hardest time I’ve had recently with switching
my creative mode off was after two hours of playing <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/39856/dixit">Dixit</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It’s wonderful to learn new things in a wide range of topics. Managing
incoming inspirations and keeping myself from multitasking is a challenge.
Which is evident even from the <a href="https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Reading-list-first-month-FqGUhYlpF1iUQx2FnbaGe">list of articles</a>
that inspired me to grow as a programmer in the past month.</p>

<h3 id="gathering-scattered-thoughts">Gathering scattered thoughts</h3>

<p>I’ve tried many approaches for managing the influx of information and my
creative output. At the moment I use a simple system:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://habitica.com/">Habitica</a> for daily tasks and my to-do list.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.one-tab.com/">OneTab</a> to convert my tabs into a list.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A plethora of text files scattered around multiple folders to note
incoming waves of ideas and save any emails or messages I
particularly liked. They mainly consist of various lists.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Although I have been using GitHub and other tools when working with others,
I haven’t found a better approach to managing my own workflow. I’ve tested
many until I realized I’m spending more time on improving productivity
than being productive.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-grow">How to grow</h3>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Set boundaries and a simple enough system that works for you.</p>

    <p>Have regular focused time and a dedicated space, even if that space is
putting your laptop on your lap. Don’t lose your focus on distractions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Work on your communication.</p>

    <p>Listen attentively and be fully in the moment whenever you decide to
talk to someone. Try to understand other perspectives and think of them
when communicating your ideas.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Get distracted in a controlled way.</p>

    <p>When it’s time to focus, try to eliminate distractions. If you can’t turn
off notifications, allows yourself to quickly assess their importance.
Take note of anything you want to investigate later.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Teach.</p>

    <p>You can rarely be sure you know something before you explain it to
someone else. Teaching is an opportunity to learn.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The term <em>disorienting level of freedom</em> is directly cited from Allison
Kaptur’s talk on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mcc6JEhDSpo">effective learning strategies for programmers</a>. It’s a great talk to watch!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes,_and..."><em>Yes, and…</em></a> is the most
important rule of improvisational theatre. Should you ever get a chance to
try improv, go for it! It was one of the best experiences during my batch at
the Recurse Center.</p>
